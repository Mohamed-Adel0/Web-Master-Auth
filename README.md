This project is part of my training at Web-Master, where I implemented and activated a verification code system for user authentication.

Features:

✅ User Registration & Login System

✅ Email & Password Validation

✅ Verification Code Activation

✅ Error Handling & User Feedback

This project was built as a learning exercise to enhance authentication security and improve my development skills
